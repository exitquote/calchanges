This is a small change to this plugin:

http://theseednetwork.com/services/websites-and-software/software/all-in-one-event-calendar-wordpress/

I'm releasing my altered version into the wild per the terms of the GPL.

My version made the following changes:

(1) create a custom name for the filter field that can be changed in the define file
(2) added functionality in several views to repurpse the ical source url field - calendar entries now link to the ical source url if one is provided.
